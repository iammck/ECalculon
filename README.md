The ECalculon project is for experimenting and learning continuous integration
concepts and techniques for Android software development.

The application is a simple calculator named after Calculon, a robot. It uses
the support library and is a fragment activity. There are several integration
tests using junit. Those that test the UI also use espresso 2.
